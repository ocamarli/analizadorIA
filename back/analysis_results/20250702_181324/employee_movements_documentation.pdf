Employee Movements Logic

1. Employees with blocked current accounts: Refund goes to the current account.
2. Employees with less than the required tenure for current account activation: Refund goes to additional savings.
3. Ex-employees: Notify HR for manual refund processing.

Error Handling:
- Log all errors during migration.
- Notify the admin for manual intervention if errors persist.
