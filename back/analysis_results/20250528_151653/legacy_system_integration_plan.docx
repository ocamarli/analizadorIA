## Legacy System Integration Plan

### Objective:
Ensure seamless handling of returns processed in legacy systems.

### Steps:
1. Identify all legacy systems involved in returns.
2. Develop APIs to fetch return data from legacy systems.
3. Implement a fallback mechanism to redirect users to legacy systems when required.
4. Provide training to operators on handling legacy system returns.

### Example API Endpoint:
`GET /legacy-returns/{returnId}`

### Error Handling:
- If legacy system is unavailable, show a message: 'Legacy system is currently unavailable. Please try again later.'
